# Christian Kesler on Github

I am Christian Kesler, a Software Engineer who specializes in Web Applications built using NodeJS or Laravel.  

During my time at Trailhead Marketing from Mar2022 to Jun2022, I created a fully custom Laravel server deployed to AWS that served as an inhouse CRM.  Shortly after I arrived, the legacy server collapsed due to a slew of deprecated dependencies.  Since I was rather inexperienced at the time (and was the only developer in the company), I opted to build something new from the ground up.  In less than 4 weeks, I was able to deploy a functional prototype CRM that interfaced with the legacy database and the Facebook API to the production environment.  Features included new client creation, existing client management, 

looking to pursue a career in Web Development and Software Engineering.  I recently completed all coursework towards my B.Sc. at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) while maintaining a 4.0 GPA.  I am set to officially graduate with honors in May, 2022.

In the meantime, I have been exploring employment opportunities and further developing my programming skills.  I've created a live website that contains my professional ePortfolio, which can be found at https://knowoneswebsiteofeverything.com/eportfolio.html.  Several of my most relevant projects are detailed within that ePortfolio, with planned additions coming in the future.  I am currently working on API integration for the website resources and a CSV to JSON file converter written in Python.  

## Python Experience

I've created miscellaneous Python programs throughout the past to serve specific purposes.  File manipulation is a common usecase, but the projects I've documented and can showcase include a three part video series you can view here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYrMngyd6OmT6hxpv-_CFq_JlnA7LoQiL

This youtube tutorial details a Python program that listens for custom key combinations and executes keystrokes as a result.  I've used a variant of this program to routinely clean up specific directories, rearrange massive spreadsheets, speed up my general computer usage by typing out common output (such as my email address), and setup my desktop each morning.  

Python is a very powerful language that can do a lot of things.  I've been focusing more on specializing in languages that serve more narrow purposes (Javascript and PHP), but I'm no stranger to Python and always enjoy learning new things.  

I have some rather large ambitions, and would like to explore neural networks and basic ML in Python at some point.  


## Javascript Experience

Javascript is my bread and butter.  My very first website (which I built in a self taught manner while attending college) utilized a hosting service that served static files.  Due to this, I had no choice but to build every single dynamic feature on the server frontend.  You can check it out here:  https://kwoe.uglesoft.com/

One key highlights include api integration (this was my first ever encounter with an api): https://kwoe.uglesoft.com/caped-crusaders/5e-srd-spells.html

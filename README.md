# Hello World!

I am Christian Kesler, a Computer Science major looking to pursue a career in Web Development and Software Engineering.  I recently completed all coursework towards my B.Sc. at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) while maintaining a 4.0 GPA.  I am set to officially graduate with honors in May, 2022.

In the meantime, I have been exploring employment opportunities and further developing my programming skills.  I've created a live website that contains my professional ePortfolio, which can be found at https://knowoneswebsiteofeverything.com/eportfolio.html.  Several of my most relevant projects are detailed within that ePortfolio, with planned additions coming in the future.  I am currently working on API integration for the website resources and a CSV to JSON file converter written in Python.  

Feel free to check out my entire website at https://knowoneswebsiteofeverything.com/, connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-kesler/, or join my website's Discord server https://discord.com/invite/ezHmjgf7d6.  
I look forward to hearing from you.  

Respectfully,
Christian Kesler
